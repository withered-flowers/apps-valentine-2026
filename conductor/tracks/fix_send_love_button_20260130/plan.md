# Implementation Plan - Fix "Send Love" Button

## Phase 1: Diagnosis & Reproduction [checkpoint: pending]
- [x] Task: Create a reproduction test case. [292e21b]
    - [x] Create a new test file `src/components/CreateCardForm.repro.test.ts` (or add to existing tests).
    - [x] Mock an authenticated user state.
    - [x] Simulate filling out the form and clicking "Send Love".
    - [x] Assert that the submission handler is NOT called or fails silently (expecting failure to confirm the bug).
- [x] Task: Analyze `CreateCardForm.svelte`. [292e21b]
    - [x] Investigate the `onsubmit` or `onclick` handlers on the button and form.
    - [x] Check for conditional logic that might effectively no-op the submission when `user` is present but the flow logic expects something else.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Diagnosis & Reproduction' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Fix & Verification [checkpoint: pending]
- [ ] Task: Implement the fix in `CreateCardForm.svelte`.
    - [ ] Correct the event handling logic to ensure `createCard` is called for authenticated users.
    - [ ] Ensure any necessary arguments (like `senderId`) are correctly passed from the auth state.
- [ ] Task: Verify with tests.
    - [ ] Update the reproduction test to assert SUCCESS (submission handler is called, card created).
    - [ ] Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions.
- [ ] Task: Manual UX Check.
    - [ ] Verify the button shows a loading state during submission.
    - [ ] Verify success feedback/redirection works.
