    - [x] Create `src/components/AuthForm.repro.test.ts`
    - [x] Write test to simulate switching from Login to Signup

## Phase 2: Implementation

    - [ ] Apply glow effect to the container during the transition state

## Phase 3: Verification & Polish
- [ ] Task: Verify Animations on Mobile
    - [ ] Check for overflow issues
    - [ ] Adjust transition duration/easing if needed for touch devices
