  "description": "Fix bug: When the user first page (the login page) changed to the second page (the signup page), it's not animated although I already add the animation. Verify animation controller setup. Ensure transitions are correctly configured. Check widget hierarchy for animation blockers. Confirm animation triggers on page change. Review navigation logic."
