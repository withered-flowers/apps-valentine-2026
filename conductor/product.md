## Overview
A modern, delightful, and romantic Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to let users create and send personalized digital Valentine's Day cards with real-time response tracking.

## Target Audience
- **Senders:** Individuals who want to express their feelings through a personalized digital experience.
- **Receivers:** Individuals who receive a unique link and interact with the card to provide a response.

## Core Goals
1. **Personalization:** Enable users to craft unique messages and choose interactive card types.
2. **Real-time Engagement:** Provide senders with immediate feedback when their card is viewed or responded to using Firebase Firestore.
3. **Premium UX:** Deliver a high-quality, romantic aesthetic using modern design principles like glassmorphism and soft animations.

## Key Features
- **Lightweight Authentication:** A simple, password-less login and signup flow using only usernames.
- **Single Card Limit:** Emphasizing the "one special person" concept by restricting each account to creating exactly one unique card.
- **Customizable Interactions:** Senders can personalize the interactive buttons (e.g., custom "Yes/No" labels) or enable a **Text Reply** feature for receivers.
- **Interactive Receiver View:** A dedicated page for the recipient featuring interactive elements, including custom buttons and a personal message response form.
- **Response Inbox:** A private dashboard where senders can monitor card status and read heartfelt text replies from their receivers in real-time.
- **QR Code Sharing:** Instant generation of unique scannable QR codes and shareable links for easy distribution.

## Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic:** Soft, vibrant, and tactile. Using a "Lavender Blush" background with "Vivid Pink" highlights and "Deep Raspberry" text for high contrast and romantic feel.
- **Tactility:** Rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`), soft pink shadows, and glassmorphism to create depth and a premium feel.
