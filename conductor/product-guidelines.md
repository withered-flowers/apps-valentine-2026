# Product Guidelines: Valentine's Day PWA

## Voice and Tone
- **Tone:** Playful and romantic.
- **Messaging:** Use affectionate and celebratory language. Phrases like "Sending some love your way!" or "Will you be mine?" should be central to the experience.

## Visual Identity
- **Style:** A blend of **Modern Glassmorphism** and **Tactile Skeuomorphism**.
- **Tactility:** Interfaces should feel both high-tech and traditional. Use frosted glass effects (blur/translucency) for cards, combined with subtle textures (like paper or lace) to evoke a physical card's feel.
- **Depth:** Use multi-layered soft pink shadows (`shadow-pink-200`) and the `rounded-2xl` corner radius to create a soft, inviting aesthetic.

## Interaction Design
- **Animations:**
    - **Heartbeat:** Primary action buttons (like "Send" or "Yes!") should have a subtle, rhythmic heartbeat animation.
    - **Micro-interactions:** Elements should respond with a "bloom" effect on hover (soft color expansion) and a slight vertical lift to indicate interactivity.
- **Feedback:** All interactions should feel "elastic" and smooth, avoiding jarring transitions.

## Brand Values
- **Intimacy:** The app should feel like a private space for two people.
- **Delight:** Every interaction, from filling a form to receiving a message, should provide a small moment of joy.
