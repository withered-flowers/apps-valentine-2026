# 💌 Be My Valentine 2026

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c29c54d8-45d2-439b-b521-e8f169eca228/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/2026-be-my-valentine/deploys)

So here's the thing—I wanted to make something special for Valentine's Day 2026, and I thought: why not build a whole app to send digital love letters? �

This little project lets you create personalized Valentine cards, send them to that special someone, and watch the magic unfold with animations, confetti, and all the romantic vibes.

## The AI-Powered Love Story 🤖✨

Let me be real with you—**this _~~entire~~_ app was partially built with AI assistance** using **Gemini CLI** (with the conductor workflow) and **Antigravity**. And honestly? It's been wild (I still need to code it myself for sharpening my skills, but overall it's been a blast).

I'm talking about going from idea to deployed app in record time. The AI helped scaffold components, write animations, debug Firebase race conditions, and even suggest better UX patterns. It's like pair programming with someone who never sleeps and has read the entire internet.

But here's where it gets interesting...

## Lessons Learned (The Real Talk) 🧠

Building with AI is incredible, but it's not all sunshine and roses. Here's what I learned:

* **Gemini CLI with conductor and Antigravity** is genuinely amazing 😁—the workflow is smooth, the context awareness is on point, and it just _gets_ what you're trying to build.

* **Speed is a double-edged sword.** Writing with AI feels blazingly fast at the start, but if you just accept everything without reviewing, the tech debt piles up _fast_. Always double-check what the AI suggests!

* **Token loops are real.** Sometimes the AI gets stuck in a loop trying to fix something, and bye bye tokens 💸. You learn to recognize when to step in.

* **Manual debugging has its place.** At some point, fixing bugs manually genuinely feels faster than waiting for AI to iterate through solutions. It's all about knowing when to take the wheel.

* **AI is scary good at UI.** Seriously, the quality of frontend code it generates is impressive. (Uh oh, frontend devs, you're being watched... 👀)

* **Local vs. production is still a minefield.** Developing with Firebase locally is _very_ different from production. Racing conditions? Oh yeah, learned that the hard way 🏎️💥

* **Astro + Svelte is a dream combo.** These frameworks are already so good, and AI knows how to use them well. Highly recommend giving them a try!

## The Tech Stack 🛠️

Here's what powers this love machine:

* **Framework**: Astro 5.0 (Hybrid mode for blazing speed ⚡)
* **UI Library**: Svelte 5 (Full Runes mode with `$state` and `$effect`—so reactive!)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom Valentine theme (pink, red, and all the hearts)
* **Animations**: `svelte-motion` for buttery smooth transitions + `canvas-confetti` for celebrations 🎉
* **Backend**: Firebase & Firestore (real-time love letters, anyone?)

You can peek at the detailed architecture in the `conductor` directory if you're into that sort of thing.

## Getting Started 🚀

Want to spread some love locally?

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Fire up the dev server:**

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to `localhost:4321` and start creating cards! 💌

## The Bottom Line 💭

This project is proof that AI-assisted development is _here_, and it's powerful. But it's not magic—it's a tool. A really, really good tool that still needs a human to guide it, review its work, and know when to step in.

Would I build another project this way? Absolutely.

Would I blindly accept every suggestion? Absolutely not.

## Credits ✨

Built with 💖 using:

* **Gemini CLI** (the conductor workflow is 🔥)
* **Antigravity** (seriously impressive AI coding assistant)
* Manual screening, proofing, and bug fixing manually (of course, AI is still hallucinating 😅)
* A lot of coffee ☕
* And maybe a little Valentine's Day magic ✨

_Happy Valentine's 2026! Now go send someone a card. 💌_
